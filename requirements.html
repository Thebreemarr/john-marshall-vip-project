  During the early presidential era, John Marshall served as a diplomat where he was a part of a mission to France in 1797, then later he became a member of the House of Representatives, and then Secretary of State under President John Adams where he focused on foreign relations with France and negotiated the Convention of 1800, before ultimately becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1801, where he stayed until his death, 34 years later.  </h3></td>
        <td><h3>
John Marshall played a significant role in US expansion by giving the Federal government the authority it needed to purchase land- since the Constitution did not include any rules or guidelines for territorial expansion. Before John Marshall increased the Federal Government's power, the Anti-Federalists were in charge and they believed in strict interpretation of the constitution meaning they believed it was illegal for America to buy land because the constitution neither allows nor prohibits it. This means that without John Marshall, we wouldn't have been able to expand our territory through land purchases such as the Louisiana Purchase.      

          </h3></td>
        <td><h3>
  During the Antebellum Era, Marshall established the court's power of Judicial review which gave the supreme court the authority of deciding whether the other 2 branches were doing things and making laws according to the constitution. This gave the Supreme Court a lot more power than it had before and made the 3 branches more equal by establishing this check of power. Marshall's leadership ensured that the federal government would have power over the state governments, and when this eventually led to the civil war- the government had the power to win.

His court case rulings defined the US judicial system along with the strength of the federal government over the states. </h3>

            Marshall's most notable contributions include the establishment of the Supreme Court's power of judicial review through Marbury v. Madison, strengthening the judicial branch, and reinforcing and increasing the federal government's authority. Besides his major achievements, he also played a significant role in shaping the nation's foreign policy during the XYZ Affair and  our policy of neutrality. He was also one of the few Americans to hold a position in each of the three branches of government.

        Marshall's legacy is that he transformed the Supreme Court from a weak branch of government to a powerful and influential one, establishing its role as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and a check on the power of the other branches. He supported federalists by ruling in their favor during his cases which was good because it encouraged economic equality across the country and created a strong government to provide structure, order, and stability.

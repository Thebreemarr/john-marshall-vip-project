    <h3>
      John Marshall was born in a log cabin in Fauquier County, Virginia, on his
      father's estate, known as Oak Hill. He had a rough childhood as he was the
      eldest of 15 children and carried many responsibilities at a young age. He
      grew up in a rural area on the Frontier which meant he had limited access
      to formal education and often faced financial struggles. John Marshall
      attended one year of college at Westmoreland County Academy, where he
      became lifelong friends with James Monroe. Most of his knowledge was
      self-taught and after he served as a Captain in the Continental Army
      during the Revolutionary War, he studied law at the College of William and
      Mary where he received his law degree in 1780. He also developed a great
      admiration for George Washington and later wrote a five-volume biography
      of him!

    <h3>
      John Marshall was elected to the Virginia Assembly in 1782 and served in
      various state government positions for roughly 15 years, helping him
      establish a strong reputation in politics. He was also involved in the Supreme Court case "Ware v. Hylton" (1796) as a lawyer where he
      defended Virginia’s law on British debts. Although Marshall ultimately
      lost the case— as the court ruled that the Treaty of Paris superseded
      state laws- the recognition would propel Marshall’s career. He was also involved during the XYZ Affair during John
      Adams presidency, recieved a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives
      (1799), and reluctantly served as Adam's secretary of state for a brief
      period of time, where he mostly negotiated relations with France. When the
      previous Chief Justice, Oliver Ellsworth, retired; Adams selected his good friend and Secretary of State; John Marshall, 
      to replace him. John Marshall was confirmed as Chief Justice on February
      4, 1801, although he remained Secretary of State until Adams left office a
      month later.

        Just 5 years after 'Ware v. Hylton', Marshall became the Chief Justice
        of the United States, and played one of the most essential roles as one
        of the nation's founding fathers.

<h3>
  John Marshall was the fourth (and longest served) Chief Justice of the United States, his time in court coming to be known as the ‘Marshall Court’ era. Marshall's decisions and opinions are still relevant in today's world, as his clauses and court cases helped establish a strong, stable, and equal federal government. His main accomplishments are the creation of judicial review, giving the supreme court power to declare laws unconstitutional (Marbury v. Madison, 1803), and defining the Constitution's necessary and proper clause- also known as the elastic clause- during the court case called McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819. Marshall interpreted the Constitution in ways that gave the Federal government significant power over the states while asserting judicial authority among the other branches to hold them accountable by the constitution. John Marshall's role as chief justice shaped our nation’s understanding of the Constitution and created the laws that built society as we know it.

    <h1 class="align-left" id="personal-life">End of Marshall Court</h1>
    <h3>

      During the final period of Marshall's court, John Marshall had started to lose influence within the court due to changes in his fellow justices when four new judges were appointed by the new president, Andrew Jackson. Marshall had to fight against Andrew Jackson's opposing beliefs since Jackson wanted to increase states’ rights while Marshall's life work was devoted to a strong federal government. Marshall was unable to take control of the situation when President Jackson refused to accept the Court’s ruling over the cases 'Cherokee Nation v. Georgia' (1831) and 'Worcester v. Georgia' (1832), when Native Americans were being forcibly removed from their land. While Marshall claimed that Georgia had no right to interfere with the Cherokee because they were “distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights," President Jackson responded by saying, "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it." This was a very famous quote because it was the first time a supreme court ruling was ignored. This event marks the major falling out of power for John Marshall and the supreme court.

    <h3>
      John Marshall was born in a log cabin in Fauquier County, Virginia, on his
      father's estate, known as Oak Hill. He had a rough childhood as he was the
      eldest of 15 children and carried many responsibilities at a young age. He
      grew up in a rural area on the frontier which meant he had limited access
      to formal education and often faced financial struggles. John Marshall
      attended one year of college at Westmoreland County Academy, where he
      became lifelong friends with James Monroe. Most of his knowledge was
      self-taught and after he served as a Captain in the Continental Army
      during the Revolutionary War, he studied law at the College of William and
      Mary where he received his law degree in 1780. He also developed a great
      admiration for George Washington and later wrote a five-volume biography
      of him!

    <h3>
      John Marshall was elected to the Virginia Assembly in 1782 and served in
      various state government positions for roughly 15 years, helping him
      establish a strong reputation in politics. He was also involved as a
      lawyer in the Supreme Court case "Ware v. Hylton" (1796), where he
      defended Virginia’s law on British debts. Although Marshall ultimately
      lost the case— as the court ruled that the Treaty of Paris superseded
      state laws- the recognition would help propel Marshall’s career within
      judicial review. He was also involved during the XYZ Affair during John
      Adams presidency, recieved a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives
      (1799), and reluctantly served as Adam's secretary of state for a brief
      period of time, where he mostly negociated relations with France. When the
      previous Chief Justice, Oliver Ellsworth, retired; Adams selected Marshall
      to replace him. John Marshall was confirmed as Chief Justice on February
      4, 1801, although he remained secretary of state until Adams left office a
      month later.

        Just 5 years after 'Ware v. Hylton', Marshall became the Chief Justice
        of the United States, and played one of the most essential roles as one
        of the nation's founding fathers.
